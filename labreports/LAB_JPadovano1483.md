# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | User Creating an 8-semeseter plan |
| Description / Steps | Messiah student creates and saves an 8-semester course plan |
| Primary Actor | Student User |
| Preconditions | 1. User signs in to application through the CAS system <br>2. User drags and drops the courses they wish to take into the semester of their choosing <br>3. User has no errors in course scheduling <br>4. User hits the save button |
| Postconditions | 1. User is able to sign back in at a later time to find the saved course plan <br>2. User is able to change their plan at any time |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

Competitor: [ECARPS](http://huggs.messiah.edu/ecarps/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sign in as a guest to the application | Simply select I am not a robot and hit the guest sign in button |
| 2 | Specify your major | Choose your major and/or minor from the list of majors/minors  |
| 3 | Rearrange courses as necessary | Drag and drop courses that are already in the default plan to other places as you see fit |
| 4 | Add any desired courses to the schedule | Drag and drop courses from the course list on the right side of the page to any semester |
| 5 | If necessary, fix any errors in scheduling | Correct aany errors the system catches in your plan |
| 6 | Sign out | Click the log out button |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sign in as a guest to the application | The sign in process was simple. The user simply needs to check off the "I am not a robot" button and hit the "sign in" button. If you are not signing in as guest and are an engineering major, your are able to simply sign in through Messiah's CAS system.|
| 2 | Specify your major | This was a simple process. The user simply has to select their major and/or minor from a check box list. They can also specify if they are in the honors program.|
| 3 | Rearrange courses as necessary | There is no problem when working with just a major, but when a minor is added, there is a large red banner on the course list. This is because the application has a default plan loaded in for the majors, but not the minors. The issue with this was that when logging in for the first time to start planning your schedule, it is quite off-putting to see a large red flag on your screen. It is a bit confusing and disorienting at first.|
| 4 | Add any desired courses to the schedule | The large list of all the classes on the right side of the screen is difficult to manage and sort through. It takes a while to scroll through all of your options and there is no easy way to find the course you are looking for. It is also a bit overwhelming to see such a large number of courses right off the bat when you are first starting the planning process. The actual drag and drop mechanic is rather straight forward, so there were no problem in that respect. |
| 5 | If necessary, fix any errors in scheduling | The error messages were straight forward and easy to understand. For example, if a course is prerequisite for a course is moved after it, there is a red banner on the semester with the conflict that says both which course is missing a prerequisite as well as what the preerequisite course is. |
| 6 | Sign out | The sign out process was simple and straight forward. The user simply needs to click the log out button on the left side of the page. |

## Step 3.5 Findings
Improvements for Usability:
1. Change course list layout
2. Add filter/search function for the courses
3. Fix red flags with first time sign in when a minor is selected

Beneficial Experiences:
1. Having a default plan for each major
2. Having all your major requirements in one place
3. Prerequisite flagging and error messages

Things we did well in usability test:
1. asked question about how the user felt and how they weree doing at certain points

Things we could improve on in test:
1. getting someone that has never heard of the ECARPS system before to test it to see a different perspective

Statement about conducting the test:
Being able to conduct a test that matches our desired product was an issue, we could not test some functions such as saving and signing back in
The test made us outline what we wanted so we got better information than if we asked for unprompted feedback
